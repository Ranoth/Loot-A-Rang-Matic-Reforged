# Loot-A-Rang Matic
This addon will try to use the [Loot-A-Rang](https://www.wowhead.com/item=60854/loot-a-rang), the [Findle's Loot-A-Rang](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109167/findles-loot-a-rang) or [Fetch](https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=125050/fetch) if you have neither and are a hunter with the spell learned upon a double click of the right button of the mouse.

It is a rewrite of [Loot-A-Rang Matic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/loot-rang-matic) by [nimids](https://www.curseforge.com/members/nimids/projects) with slightly altered functionality as I wrote it for myself.

> Blizzard's API restrictions apply so you can't use it in combat or while moving.  

## Reporting Bugs
Be sure to let me know if you find any bugs or issues with the addon.

> You can of course report bugs in the comment section of the addon's page on CurseForge, however I would prefer if you could report them on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Ranoth/Loot-A-Rang-Matic-Reforged/issues).
